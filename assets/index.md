Intro
---
Full Stack Developer currently based in Louisville, KY.

Since then I've been working on expanding my toolkit and honing my skills with proper design & architecture.  I'm also always interested in the academic and theoretical aspects of programming, so I tend to get hooked on exploring a new concept.

Outside of work, my interests are statistics, physics, and cognitive science, as well as hiking and exploring nature, going to the gym, and sci fi shows.
