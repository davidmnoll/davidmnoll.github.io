Intro
---
I'm a full stack developer.  After growing up in the 90's and early 2000's learning HTML, JavaScript, and Java, I became interested in cognitive science & linguistics.  Eventually I came back around into programming through IT and WordPress development, and as I started learning more than I had before, my interest snowballed.

Since then I've been working on expanding my toolkit and honing my skills with proper design & architecture.  I'm also always interested in the academic and theoretical aspects of programming, so I tend to get hooked on exploring a new concept.

Outside of work, my interests are statistics, physics, and cognitive science, as well as hiking and exploring nature, going to the gym, and sci fi shows.
