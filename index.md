Intro:
---
I'm a full stack developer.  After growing up in the 90's and early 2000's learning the HTML, JavaScript, and Java, I became interested in cognitive science & linguistics.  Eventually I came back around into programming through IT and WordPress development. 

Since then I've been working on expanding and honing my skills with proper design & architecture.

Outside of work, my intersts are statistics, physics, and cognitive science, as well as hiking and exploring nature, going to the gym, and sci fi shows.
